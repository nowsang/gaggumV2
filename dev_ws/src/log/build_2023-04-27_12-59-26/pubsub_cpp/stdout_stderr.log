CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsocket.io-client-cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "socket.io-client-cpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "socket.io-client-cpp" with any of the following names:

    socket.io-client-cppConfig.cmake
    socket.io-client-cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "socket.io-client-cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "socket.io-client-cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "socket.io-client-cpp" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
